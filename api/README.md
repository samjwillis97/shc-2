# SHC the 2nd

## Some thoughts

- Plugins;
    - what if I want one to ask for user input? like a token
    - a way to show all the used variables and hooks/functions etc.
- Make a cache available in the context object passed to functions
- How to handle removing something, i.e. an endpoint doesn't want to use a query param set by the parent
- Handle collections of workspaces, somehow
