# SHC the 2nd

## Some thoughts

- Imports
    - import and merge another config file
- Plugins can;
    - define/use variables
    - what if I want one to ask for user input? like a token
    - a way to show all the used variables and hooks/functions etc.
- How to handle variables, are variable _sets_ still the go?
- Make a cache available in the context object passed to functions
- Templating?
    - I guess just recrusively traversing strings, with exceptions
